As an architect, I have always loved the idea of bringing something abandoned or empty back to life, reimagining it as a place for people to live in and experience.

I recently came across a fantastic YouTube channel called [So, We Found This Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/@sowefoundthisruin), which documents this exact journey. The project looks both exhilarating and terrifying. From the sheer difficulty of accessing the site to convincing authorities that some of the spaces once had roofs, the challenges are immense.

They are only at the beginning of this incredible undertaking, and I am really looking forward to seeing how the ruin evolves.
