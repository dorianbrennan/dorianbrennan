>It's an unprecedented deal for the author, whose 'Mistborn' series and 'The Stormlight Archive' are being eyed for film and television adaptation, respectively.

From the [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/brandon-sandersons-mistborn-stormlight-archive-movie-tv-1236487271/) comes some fantastic news for Brandon Sanderson fans. It seems Apple has secured the rights to the [Cosmere](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/pages/what-is-the-cosmere) books and is beginning to explore adaptations of Mistborn and The Stormlight Archive series.

What’s even better is that Sanderson will retain creative control over the adaptations.

I’m a big fan of The Stormlight Archive, and given how well Apple has adapted other books, I have high hopes for this project.

There’s no word yet on when filming might begin or when the series will be released.
