Ferrari [recently unveiled](https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/auto/ferrari-luce) the interior of its first fully electric car. The interior was designed by Jony Ive and Marc Newson, working together at LoveFrom.

There’s a lot to like about the design, but one small detail really stands out what happens when the key is placed into its slot. The key itself features the beautiful Ferrari logo in that unmistakable yellow. Once inserted and pressed down, the yellow from the key transfers to the top of the gear shifter knob.

It’s such a subtle detail, but it creates a sense of movement, as though the car is coming alive.

I’m looking forward to seeing how the finished design comes together.
