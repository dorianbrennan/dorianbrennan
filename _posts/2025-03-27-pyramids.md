The pyramids have always had a draw for me. From learning about them in school to being able to visit them in 2011, they are awe-inspiring structures. 

So [this new](https://www.jpost.com/archaeology/archaeology-around-the-world/article-847207) discovery of what appears to be 8 cylindrical pillars that go 648m below the Great Pyramid’s base and that sit atop two 80-meter-by-80-meter chambers is astonishing. 

I am looking forward to seeing what else they find.
